### About the project ###
BILFO (Bilkent Information Office application) aims to streamline and modernize how high schools, prospective students, university administrators, and information office staff interact with the BTO. Our goal is to simplify and automate the process of booking visitations, tours, and fairs by building a full-stack web application. This web app will solve several logistical issues related to planning and scheduling such activities by offering an organized, user-friendly platform. Currently, booking visitations or tours to Bilkent requires manual coordination, which can be inefficient for both visitors and the university staff. The app will serve information office staff directly by reducing administrative workload and providing them with comprehensive data along with services in one centralized system.

Key Problems Solved: 
* Automating campus tour bookings for high schools and assignment of their guides.
* Introducing a new high school prioritization system for tour bookings and customized tours.
* Providing a platform that offers real-time updates and communication between the university and visitors.
* Ensuring that all relevant stakeholders (high schools and their counselors, prospective students, admins, information office advisors, information office coordinator and guides) can access the information they need easily.

## Features ##
* Interface: Separate interfaces for visitors, admins, advisors, guides and the coordinator.
* Booking System: High schools and individuals can schedule campus visits and tours. High schools  fill the application form within the system which is later seen by advisors with the priority order. The application form includes terms & conditions, number of students, contact information, and busy hours to lower the number of rejections.
* Notifications & Reminders: Email reminders and confirmation for upcoming events.
* Dashboard: Admins and coordinators can manage visits, view schedules, and add/remove guides. Also, only the admin can see the gathered data within the system.
### Selling Points ###
* Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
* Automated booking and scheduling.
* Personalized experiences for different user types.
* Real-time notifications and updates.
